## Notes

I encounter a challenge while implementing the camera function because UIImagePickerController.InfoKey.phAsset is deprecated since iOS 11; hence I can't get the location for the image from UIImagePickerController.
I ended up using CLLocationManager to fetch the location for the picture snapped with camara launched from the app.
